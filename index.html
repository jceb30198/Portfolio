          Hello there, I am Jack Ceballos and I would like to welcome you to my web page! During my free time I enjoy
          homebrewing beer, reading, building computers, and fishing. Since 2019 I have been working in breweries around
          the
          Miami-Dade county and have met many interesting people that share the same passion for beer that I do. I
          currently
          work at Unbranded Brewing Company in Hialeah where I am the lead cellar-man which is essentially the main
          person
          in charge for quality control. In May of 2020 I graduated from Florida International University with a degree
          in
          International Business Administration. Due to graduating in the middle of a pandemic and not being able to
          find
          any work with my degree, I decided to sign up for this coding bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p class="white-text">
          Ever since I was young I have always been infatuated with computers and now I am taking a class to help me
          learn
          more about what it takes to develop websites. I built my first computer when I was in the 8th grade and since
          then
          I have built a couple computers for my family members. The beginning of this class has been very challenging
          yet
          enjoyable because I have learned so many new skills that help me to reach my goal of becoming a full-stack
          developer. I am hoping to start making websites a lot better than this one soon so that I can make websites
          for
          companies and for my friends along with family members.
        </p>
