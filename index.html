      Hello there, I am Jack Ceballos and I would like to welcome you to my web page! During my free time I enjoy
      homebrewing beer, reading, building computers, and fishing. Since 2019 I have been working in breweries around the
      Miami-Dade county and have met many interesting people that share the same passion for beer that I do. I currently
      work at Unbranded Brewing Company in Hialeah where I am the lead cellar-man which is essentially the main person
      in charge for quality control. In May of 2020 I graduated from Florida International University with a degree in
      International Business Administration. Due to graduating in the middle of a pandemic and not being able to find
      any work with my degree, I decided to sign up for this coding bootcamp.
    </p>

    <p class="text-light m-4">
      Ever since I was young I have always been infatuated with computers and now I am taking a class to help me learn
      more about what it takes to develop websites. I built my first computer when I was in the 8th grade and since then
      I have built a couple computers for my family members. The beginning of this class has been very challenging yet
      enjoyable because I have learned so many new skills that help me to reach my goal of becoming a full-stack
      developer. I am hoping to start making websites a lot better than this one soon so that I can make websites for
      companies and for my friends along with family members.
    </p>
